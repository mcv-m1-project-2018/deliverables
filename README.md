#Instructions for submission

- Upload the code to your team repository, using a folder named weekX (X in range 1-5)
- Use the issues section to share your weekly report. For each submission you will find an issue opened by us. You will
  have to reply to this issue and publish the link to your public Google Presentation slides.
- Do not upload the result masks or .pkl files to your repository. Put the results in a folder in the virtual server named:
  /home/mcvYY/m1-results/weekX/test/
  
  If you generate the results in your local machine, you can use scp from a local terminal (MobaXterm recommended for Windows users) 
  or you can use any file transfer program to copy the files to the server.
